#KNOWLEDGE START FROM HERE . UNDERSTAND HTTP ERRORS CODE STATUS
#The HTTP response status code 302 Found is a common way of performing URL redirection. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) initially defined this code, and gave it the description phrase "Moved Temporarily" rather than "Found".

#An HTTP response with this status code will additionally provide a URL in the header field Location. This is an invitation to the user agent (e.g. a web browser) to make a second, otherwise identical, request to the new URL specified in the location field. The end result is a redirection to the new URL. 

#Client request:

#GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
#Host: www.example.com

#Server response:

#HTTP/1.1 302 Found
#Location: http://www.iana.org/domains/example/
